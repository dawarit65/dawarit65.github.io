### Overview
- Markdown: This is a popular lightweight markup lannguage that serves as alternative to HTML. Due to its flexibility, Markdown is used in almost every documentation tool. There are variations of Markdown syntax such as GitHub Flavoured Markdown(GFM).

- GitHub Pages: This is a service provided by GitHub that allows users to host Markdown files (.md) online as websites.

- Jekyll: This is a static site generator with various templates that are set up to work with Markdown files within the GitHub Pages.

### Prerequisites
- Have a resume formatted in Markdown

- Create a GitHub account

### Principles of Andrew Etter's book
In Etter's book: _Modern Technical Writing_, Etter outlines general processes and concepts for the writing process for a technical writer. Etter describes that the writing process for modern technical writing involves using a lightweight markup language (such as Markdown) along with a static site generator (i.e Jekyll) and a website host page (such as GitHub Pages). Etter states that technical writers should adopt this writing process not only for the ease of use but also, to keep your information from going out of date like PDFs. In addition to these, Etter advices that a technical writer should not write often; a technical writer should do more of research and testing rather than writing. In fact, he suggests writing should be done after gaining a solid understanding of how things works and what one's userbase would like to know in the documentation.

## FAQs

- Why has my theme not changed?

   Sometimes it takes a couple of minutes for any change to the Jekyll slate theme to be effective.
   
- Why is Markdown better than word processor?
   
   Markdown is better than word processor because it is easier to format plain text for webpages and convert to HTML than a word processor.
